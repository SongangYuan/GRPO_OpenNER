- Score 10: Proactively identifies key ambiguities/errors with clear evidence and proposes concrete, feasible fixes; explains expected impact on NER.
- Score 7–9: Identifies relevant issues with some support and plausible fixes, but coverage/justification is incomplete.
- Score 4–6: Vague mentions of issues without clear detection or actionable steps; weak linkage to evidence.
- Score 1–3: Misidentifies issues or proposes irrelevant/incorrect fixes.
- Score 0: No awareness of errors or ambiguities.
