- Score 10: Thoroughly considers multiple interpretations/candidates with explicit evidence; compares trade-offs and justifies the final decision clearly.
- Score 7–9: Considers more than one perspective with some comparison, but coverage or evidence is incomplete.
- Score 4–6: Mentions alternatives without real comparison or evidence-based trade-offs; superficial handling.
- Score 1–3: Ignores plausible alternatives or compares them incorrectly.
- Score 0: Single-track thinking with no alternative consideration.
