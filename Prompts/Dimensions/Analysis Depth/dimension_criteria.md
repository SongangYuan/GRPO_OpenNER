- Score 10: Deep, nuanced analysis that explicitly cites evidence from the analysis, uncovers implicit semantics/context, addresses counter-cases, and remains consistent with the NER query and gold entities.
- Score 7–9: Solid analysis with some depth and relevant evidence, but certain aspects are unexplored or justification is incomplete; no major contradictions.
- Score 4–6: Mostly surface-level observations with limited semantic exploration or weak/implicit evidence; minor inconsistencies may appear.
- Score 1–3: Shallow or partly incorrect analysis with unsupported claims or contradictions to context/result.
- Score 0: No meaningful analysis or entirely off-topic/contradictory reasoning.
