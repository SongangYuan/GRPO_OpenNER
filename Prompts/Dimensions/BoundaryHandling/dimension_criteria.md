- Score 10: Thoroughly explains boundary choices for each entity with explicit evidence; considers plausible alternative spans and justifies inclusions/exclusions; consistent with gold entities.
- Score 7–9: Explains most boundary choices with reasonable support, but some entities are brief or alternatives not fully evaluated; no major inconsistencies.
- Score 4–6: Mentions boundary issues superficially or inconsistently; limited evidence or conflicts with the final result appear.
- Score 1–3: Incorrect or weak boundary reasoning not grounded in the text; significant justification gaps.
- Score 0: No discussion of entity boundaries or clearly wrong handling.
