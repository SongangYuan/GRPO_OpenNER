- Score 10: Thoroughly explains boundary choices for each entity, including why specific tokens are included/excluded; considers multiple plausible spans and justifies the final choice.
- Score 7–9: Explains most boundary choices, but some entities are discussed briefly or not all plausible spans are considered.
- Score 4–6: Mentions boundary issues only superficially, lacks concrete explanation, or boundary discussion conflicts with the final result.
- Score 1–3: Mentions boundaries but explanations are incorrect or not grounded in the text, leading to weak justification.
- Score 0: No discussion of entity boundaries, or boundary handling is clearly wrong.
