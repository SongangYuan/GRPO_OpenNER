# Task Description
You are a professional NER (Named Entity Recognition) quality evaluator. Your task is to analyze the given NER example and decide which potential evaluation dimensions are relevant and should be evaluated. Judge relevance using both the original text and the NER query (the target entity-type description).

## Evaluation Context
- Original text: {original_text}
- NER query: {ner_query}
- Model analysis: <analysis>{analysis_content}</analysis>
- Model NER result: <ner_result>{ner_result}</ner_result>
- Gold entities: {gold_entities}

## Potential dimensions (decide per example whether they are relevant)
1. Boundary Handling: Does the analysis explicitly discuss how entity boundaries are determined, especially when boundaries are ambiguous or boundary errors are likely?
2. Error Detection and Correction: Does the analysis identify potential ambiguities or mistakes and propose how to correct them?
3. Domain Knowledge Application: Does the analysis apply domain-specific knowledge to support entity recognition?
4. Language Quality: Is the analysis clear, precise, and professional in wording and structure? (Always relevant, but importance may vary.)
5. Analysis Depth: Does the analysis go beyond surface matching to explore contextual and semantic layers? (More relevant for complex texts.)
6. Multi-perspective Thinking: Does the analysis consider multiple plausible interpretations when multiple explanations are possible?

Tip: When judging whether a dimension is relevant, be guided by the NER query (target entity type). Focus on whether the dimension directly helps recognition, disambiguation, boundary decisions, or evidence-based reasoning for that entity type.

## Comparison and mapping guidance (use analysis_content + ner_result vs gold_entities)
- Compare the model NER result and the gold entities, identify difference types, and infer which dimensions explain or prevent those differences, taking into account the model analysis:
  - Boundary error / span mismatch → Likely related to insufficient or effective Boundary Handling
  - Type error (e.g., mistaking an algorithm for a model, or an organization for a location) → Likely related to insufficient or effective Domain Knowledge Application
  - False positives / false negatives (precision/recall issues) → May relate to insufficient or effective Analysis Depth and/or Multi-perspective Thinking (did it consider multiple candidates and provide evidence?)
  - No self-check/correction or risk awareness in the analysis → Likely related to insufficient or effective Error Detection and Correction
  - Vague expression or inaccurate terminology causing misunderstanding → May relate to insufficient or effective Language Quality
- If ner_result and gold_entities are highly consistent, point out which dimensions support that consistency (e.g., strong domain knowledge, deep analysis, multi-perspective trade-offs), and mark those dimensions as relevant.

## Your steps
1. Carefully read the original text, the NER query, and the model analysis.
2. Compare the model NER result with the gold entities; summarize difference types (e.g., boundary, type, false positive, false negative), and infer which dimensions most likely caused these differences or supported the observed consistency.
3. Decide which potential dimensions (1–6) are relevant and should be evaluated in this example.
   - Guided by the NER query: Does the dimension directly help identify the entity type requested by the query? If not, mark it as not relevant.
   - Relevance criterion: The dimension must provide meaningful evaluation information; skip if not relevant.
   - For example: If the query focuses on “algorithm/method,” then Domain Knowledge Application and Analysis Depth are more likely to be relevant; if there is no boundary dispute, Boundary Handling may be irrelevant.
4. For each relevant dimension, provide a brief reason explaining why it should be evaluated in this example (you may cite the query target, the difference types between ner_result and gold_entities, and evidence from analysis_content).

## Output Format
Strictly output the following JSON only, with no extra text:
{
  "relevant_dimensions": [
    {
      "relevance_reason": "There are multiple plausible boundary choices, e.g., 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma' could be recognized as either 'non-Hodgkin' or 'non-Hodgkin lymphoma'.",
      "dimension_name": "Boundary Handling"
    },
    {
      "relevance_reason": "This task involves the medical domain; domain knowledge is needed to correctly identify disease names.",
      "dimension_name": "Domain Knowledge Application"
    }
  ]
}

Notes:
- The "dimension_name" must be strictly chosen from the six items listed above (1–6). No other names are allowed.
- The "relevance_reason" must explain why evaluating this dimension is necessary for this example (you may explicitly relate it to the NER query’s target type, the comparison between ner_result and gold_entities, and evidence from analysis_content).
